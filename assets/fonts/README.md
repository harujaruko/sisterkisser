Place the Arno Pro font files here so the site can load them.

Recommended filenames (used by `style.css`):
- `ArnoPro-Regular.otf`        (original OpenType file)
- `ArnoPro-Regular.woff2`     (recommended for web)
- `ArnoPro-Regular.woff`      (fallback)

How to use:
- Add the `ArnoPro-Regular.otf` (or `.woff2`) file into this folder.
- The site CSS references `assets/fonts/ArnoPro-Regular.otf`.

Converting to WOFF/WOFF2:
- Use FontForge, `fonttools` or an online converter to produce `woff`/`woff2` formats.

If you'd like, I can add `woff2`/`woff` versions if you provide the source font file or grant permission to include it in the repo.
